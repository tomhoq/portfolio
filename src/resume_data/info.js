        follow closely and for that purpose I often read articles and papers on the subject.
        I have also taken some online courses like Google’s “Introduction to Generative AI”

        `Sports are a big part of my life. I began playing roller hockey and tennis at the age of 5 and 6, 
        respectively, and these 2 have been prevalent ever since, with some others coming and going in the meantime.
        Two years ago, I also began attending the gym regularly.`,
